# GHG-Emissions-Quantification-and-Reporting-Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on quantifying and analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from facility-level data across Canada. The analysis identifies major emitting industries, provinces, and trends in emissions over time, with visualizations to support data-driven policy decisions.

🔍 Key Objectives

Assess GHG emissions trends from 2004-2022.
Identify top emitting provinces and industrial facilities.
Compare CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O contributions to total emissions.
Provide Power BI visualizations for stakeholders and policymakers.
📊 Data Sources

Canada’s National Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)
Environment Canada – Emissions Inventory Reports
Provincial Environmental Agencies
🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) - Data processing & analysis
Power BI – Interactive dashboards for emissions insights
Excel – Data cleaning & structuring
📈 Analysis & Visualizations

Line Chart: Total emissions trend (2004-2022).

Bar Chart: Top 10 highest-emitting provinces and facilities.

Pie Chart: GHG breakdown by gas type (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O).

Comparative Analysis: Emissions before and after 2020.

🚀 How to Run the Analysis

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Run ghg_analysis.py to generate key insights.

Import ghg_emissions_cleaned.csv into Power BI for interactive visualizations.

📢 Key Takeaways

CO₂ emissions account for the majority of total GHG emissions, followed by CH₄ and N₂O.
Certain provinces and industrial sectors dominate emissions, making them prime targets for reduction strategies.
Post-2020 trends show shifts in emissions, influenced by regulatory changes and technological adoption.
📌 Future Improvements

Incorporate policy impact analysis to assess regulations.
Expand dataset to include global emissions comparisons
